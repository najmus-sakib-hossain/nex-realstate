# Nex Realstate

Real State project for nex groups.

Before doing anything just please understand the prompt and attaichments - after proper planning create tasklist and then complate those tasks one by one sytematically.

As you can see from the screenshot at admin panel we have some issues:

- There are two save buttons but there should be only one so keep the bottom save button and its currently failting to save so please make it work properly.

- In the sidebar header there is still old "Nex Realstate" logo is showing but we have updated the logo so please update that logo to the new one. And even in the bottom of the sidebar instead of shadcn-ui avatar component "A" please put the default logo there.

- Currenlty the sidebar content should only be scrollable not the whole sidebar including the header and footer so please fix that issue.

Even through we have footer in the frontend but still we don't have admin panel header to control footer so please study the frontend footer and create admin panel header to control that navbar. Use public/logo.png as the header logo and make sure that you put default value as the current footer values use value with zod, zustand, tanstack query and react-hook-form not placeholder and when image input it should show image preview before upload. And there please use shadcn ui components with shadcn-ui design system only!!!
