# Nex Realstate

Real State project for nex groups.

Before doing anything just please understand the prompt and attaichments - after proper planning create tasklist and then complate those tasks one by one sytematically.

Even through we have footer in the frontend but still we don't have admin panel header to control footer so please study the frontend footer and create admin panel header to control that navbar. Use public/logo.png as the header logo and make sure that you put default value as the current footer values use value with zod, zustand, tanstack query and react-hook-form not placeholder and when image input it should show image preview before upload. And there please use shadcn ui components with shadcn-ui design system only!!!
