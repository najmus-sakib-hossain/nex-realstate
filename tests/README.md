So, first before you do anything make sure that you know about this project goal and its context then create a tasklist and then complete those tasklist step by step systematically.

Now, please create admin dashboard pages for all frontned pages and make sure to use all reacts packages like zod, react-form, zustand, tanstack query, shadcn-ui components and make sure that all pages are dynamic and please use current hardcoded data as default valus and make sure all frontend pages has a admin dashboard page so that I can control frontend page's text, image and video but not the colors or thigs like that - and make sure whenever I click save on admin dashboard it should show me a shadcn-ui sonner toast and it will auto update the frontend page's data so that I don't need to refresh it!!! Please use shadcn-ui table correctly for all page that needs it and please put shadcn-ui charts and show recent actios and actitivies details in the admin dashboard home page.

We don't need any user authentication or admin signup just need a login page with hardcoded credentials like email: admin@gmail.com and password: password - then please check if all frontend pages are dynamic or not and if not then please make them dynamic using zustand and react-query and shadcn-ui components and design system. There must not be any hardcoded text, image or video data in frontend pages everything must be dynamic and come from admin dashboard panel.

So, even how the homepage top hero don't have a parallax scrolling effect. Not only that I don't even see any image there so fix that correctly this time!!!

I viewed the project you did which is nice and good but please do these 3 tasks:
1. At the home page at first hero section the image must be parallex scrolling effect when user scroll down the page the image must have parallax scrolling effect so please implement that using motion package you already used in the project.
2. You have created so many page but in many pages the background and text colors are bad so they are looking bad or can't read properly so please fix those color issues and make sure all the pages text and background colors are good and readable. Maintaining shadcn-ui design system color pallete.
3. There are many pages like in the Services, Projects and Products navbar dropdown that you didn't created yet so please create those pages with some dummy data and images from unsplash and make sure the pages are looking professional and good using shadcn-ui components and design system.

This is a real state project for managing properties, clients, and transactions efficiently called "Nex Realstate" - In this project I have used laravel with intertia react technology stack and using tailwindcss and shadcn-ui for styling and components. Now you can use zustand for state management and react-query for server state management. Its a CMS like project so first I will mostly create frontend as I am good at it and then you have to create admin dashboard panel for those frontend pages the idea is to that all frontend page's text, images, videos and other content can be managed by the admin dashboard by the admin and in some cases there are contact or careeor job records where we will use shadcn-ui data table for showing all the users who submitted their details and the admin can manage their records like delete or export or view details from the admin panel and for this project we don't need any user authentication as this is a CMS like project and don't to do any signup just need a page to for user login with hardcoded credentials like email: admin@gmail.com and password: password so that only admin can access the admin dashboard panel. As I said that I will create the frontend pages but first please create professional template and files and folder stucture and create all page with some dummy data use image from unslash and configure zustand and react-query and everything so that when I put save from admin panel it should show save shadcn-ui sonner toast and then auto update the frontend page with new data without refreshing the page. So please make sure to do all these things step by step and systematically. I will now give me details for this project and your job is to create and configure all pages and files and folder stucture as a professional developer with some place pages as the project I will test the stack and plus you can use more react libaray to make this project more professional and after the stucture is completed I will myself complate the frontend pages and then you can create admin dashboard panel for managing those frontend pages data. So please make sure to do all these things step by step and systematically.
